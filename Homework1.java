/**
 * Homework 1 for CSC-281.001 Spring 2017
 * 
 * Your codename:
 * 
 * This assignment consists of 7 problems. Problem 1 asks you to modify existing
 * code for three subproblems.The remaining six problems each require you to 
 * write a method that satisfies the requirements stated in their descriptions.
 * 
 * You are required to create a javadoc style comment for each method you
 * create. See the sample method named add3 for an example to follow. 
 * 
 * Your homework will be graded in the following manner:
 * 70 points for correctness.
 * 		10 points per problem.
 * 		Does your input match the expected output exactly?
 * 30 points for following standards. Evaluation considerations for these points:
 *		Did you use vi to craft your code?
 *		Are camel case and Pascal case used correctly?
 * 		Did you follow the the submission instructions properly?

   * PROBLEM 2
   *
   * When a double or float is cast into an integer via (int), the fractional part of the number
   * after that decimal place is thrown away (e.g. 3.3 becomes 3). An example: int x = (int)3.3;
   * 
   * 1) Write a method called "topInt" that takes a double as a parameter and returns an int that
   * is rounded up from the double instead of being rounded down.
   *
   * For example, 4.5 would become 5 (the lack of a decimal point after 5 is important). Take care
   * that your method does not round up numbers with no fractions (i.e. 5.0 should not be rounded
   * up to 6.0).
   *
   * Hint: use a method in the math package that we covered in class.
   * 
   * Your method will be ran with the following input: 1.5 5.1 1.0 -4.2

   * data type. The output of this method is the printed box. This means there will be no return
   * statement in this method.

   * last name. It should return a String that contains the last name concatenated with a comma, a
   * space, the first letter of the first name, and a period.
   *

   * PROBLEM 5

   * value of the three.

   * PROBLEM 6
   * 1) Write a method named fibonacci that calculates
   * Fibonacci numbers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
   *
   * Your fibonacci method should have a single int as its only parameter. It should return
   * the fibonacci number as in int.
   *
   * Assume the seed values of F(0) = 1 and F(1) = 1.
   *
   * This method should use recursion which means the method should call itself. 
   *
   * Your method will be ran on following input: 0,1,2,3,10,25
   */
   
  /* PROMBLEM 7
   * A palindrome is where a word or sentence is spelled the same
   * forward as it is backward. For example, "pop" is a palindrome where "cat" is not. The sentence
   * "Was it a car or a cat I saw" is a palindrome when the spaces are extracted and it is converted
   * to all lowercase letters.
   *
   * 1) Write a method named "isPalindrome" that takes a single String parameter. It should return
   * the boolean value of true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not.
   *
   * Your method is only expected to run correctly on input consisting only of lowercase strings.
   *
   * Your method will be ran on the following input:
   * "racecar"
   * "cat"
   * "hannah"
   * "saippuakivikauppias"
   * 
   * hint: build a string that is the reverse of the input
